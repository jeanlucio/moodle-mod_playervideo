 * Removes the plugin's user preferences before core uninstalls the plugin.
 *
 * This hook only handles cleanup that core does NOT perform automatically. During
 * uninstall, core (uninstall_plugin() in lib/adminlib.php) already drops every table
 * declared in db/install.xml and removes all admin settings, so neither is repeated here.
 * User preferences live in the core {user_preferences} table, which core never touches, so
 * the plugin must clean its own here (currently just intro_service's site-wide "seen intro"
 * flag).
 *
 * For a mod_* plugin, core calls the function named 'xmldb_' . $modulename . '_uninstall'
 * (uninstall_plugin() in lib/adminlib.php uses the short module name, not the full
 * 'mod_playervideo' component, for this specific plugin type).
